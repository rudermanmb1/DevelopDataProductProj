##Mean MPG Analysis Instructions
* When the application starts it will automatically give an 
output of all car models from all companies in the data set.  
* The application will also report the mean miles per gallon (mpg) 
all cars get as well as the mpg of the best and worst car or cars, and 
the name of those corresponding cars.  
* If you click on the company names you are interested in, the
application will create a list of car models made only by that/those company/companies
and *calculate* the mean of only those models.  The application will also
report which of those cars have the best and worst mpg and will show that mpg.
